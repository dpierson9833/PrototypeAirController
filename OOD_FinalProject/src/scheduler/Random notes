1-25 scheduled to depart at same time, 26-50, 51-75, 76-99
when flights fall under the same time table, push those flights into some type of list
once the quarter lists are created they need to do something
that something is if the are in the qtrNArriving list they need to assigned to a GateID corresponding to the expectedGateID, if thet ID is occupied, assign to an empty gate. (create an enum for gateIDs)
if they are in the qtrNTakeOff list they need to be sent to the take off class, and handled there.
